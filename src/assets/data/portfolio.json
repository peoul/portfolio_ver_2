    "content": "Hey there! I'm a frontend developer with a Computer Science background from Oregon State (3.93 GPA, not to brag ðŸ˜‰) and currently pursuing my Master's at Johns Hopkins with a perfect 4.0. I've been working as an IT Technician for 3+ years, helping students and faculty while mentoring new team members. I love building user-friendly applications and solving problems - whether it's debugging React components or helping someone troubleshoot their computer. When I'm not coding, I'm probably working on side projects or optimizing my daily habits (hence the streak tracker).",
